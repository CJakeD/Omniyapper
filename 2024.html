    2024 Started with a festive attitude as my Family prepared delectable foods in preparation for the brand-new year. With food like Crispy Pata, Cakes, Shrimps, Fried Lumpia, and Chocolates, we were munching on them the entire time until the midnight comes around.
    <br><br>
    2024 was also the year when imperial yellow was considered a lucky color, so we spared no effort into making sure our clothes fit appropriately with luck.

  <p class="meat">
    Physical Education's last project was entirely different. Students from all around the campus performed in a different city, with coordinated movement and props. The journey of getting there, practicing under the heat of the sun until late made it one of the most challenging yet exhilirating task in all of my college years. 
    <br><br>
    Though we were there to practice and perform our dance, we made sure to eat good food and take in the nice sceneries around us. Of course, pictures are expected~

  <p class="meat">
    2024 was a year of good food. I was able to eat a variety of delectable meals, from fried chicken and fries to sticky soups. Some are tasty, and some are well... interesting. It's definitely one of the highlights of my year!
    <br><br>
    Of course, as much as I love to eat, I must also supplement it with nutritious diet and adequate exercise.

  <p class="meat">
    As 2024 was nearing its end, we decided to visit and explore the humongous Simala Church. Filled with lots of people, it was difficult to traverse the entire church. But we were able to do what we aimed to do in the end.
    <br><br> 
    Visiting Simala was an interesting experience indeed!

    There you have it, folks! 2024 came by in lightning speed. One day you were celebrating new years with you family, the next, you're celebrating the new year's eve once again. Fret not on the challenges you face, for it is but a drop on the ocean of the thing we call life. Until next time!
